## Day 24
### *Write down your long term goals. What do you want to have accomplished in 3 months? 6 months? A year?*
#### 7/24/2018

The original prompt for today was:

>Memento mori. “Remember that you will die.” Meditate on this, and write out your thoughts. Does death scare you? Does it motivate you?

I really don't like that question. I don't like to think about death, and it feels like a bit more of a personal reflection than a public blog entry. So, I'll write about my long term goals as the prompt above states.

## 3 months

Within the next three months, I want to finish the freelance project that I have going. I should be able to finish it within this time frame since it's probably about a third (maybe more) complete now. Its the first big freelance project that I have had the opportunity to work on, and it has been awesome. I hope that my next project is something using a web technology, since this one is building a Windows Application.

I also want to finish my portfolio. I have a broken site built with GatsbyJS that looks halfway decent, but is nowhere near finished. I'd like to hook it up to publish blog posts there, but I have a lot of work to do before it's at that point.

I also want to get some significant wedding planning done. We need to find a photographer, get engagement photos taken, do some tastings for the caterer, send out save the dates, and more. All of these things are something that we should be able to accomplish within the next three months. After all, we don't have much choice.

## 6 months

Within 6 months, I want to begin organizing a meetup for Angular in Louisville. My employer is more than willing to assist in this effort by providing a space and food, so I just need to gather a crowd and establish some content. There is a pretty sizeable demand for something like that around here, but there isn't anything that caters specifically to Angular. Maybe I'll call it ngLou.

I also want to tackle some of the home improvement projects. Far too long I've put off fixing the leaky sink faucet in the bathroom, or fixing the leaning fence post for good. I want to paint my office with something awesome -- I'm thinking white walls with an orange accent. Its gonna look great!

## 1 year

First and foremost, I want to get married! We've set a date for the 30th of June in 2019. All of the planning and setup behind it needs to take place first, but it is going to be spectacular on the day of.

I want to get at least as big of a raise next year as I did this year. If I keep up with my goals and continue dedicating myself to learning and doing the best I can at work, I think I have a pretty good shot.
