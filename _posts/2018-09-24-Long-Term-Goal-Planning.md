subtitle: It's been some time since we planned out long term goals. Let's check up on where we are and do some more long-term planning.

It's been two months as of today since I created my first long-term goal planning entry (which you can find [here]({{site.url}}/aom-journal/2018/07/24/day-24.html)). I know I created goals for three, six, and 12 month intervals, but "Create long-term goals" came across my to-do list recently so I'd like to check in on the status of my existing goals as well as create new ones. Here's the goals I've come up with for today:

## Existing 3 month goals

Finishing my freelance project was at the top of the list. I don't think that I'll finish it within the next month, and that's simply because the scope grew to more than I can realistically finish in that timeframe. The primary functionality of the project can be finished within the next month, but the new stuff will take more time. This will be on my upcoming long-term goals list.

I said I wanted to finish my portfolio, which may happen within the next month, but I don't know if it will for sure. I actually started from scratch with it again, going all the way back to the design phase. The design of my initial portfolio ended up being something I didn't like. I couldn't get everything I wanted on it to fit within the design I had built for myself, so I started over.

I also said I wanted to get some wedding planning done, and I most certainly have. We have selected a photographer and had our engagement photos done, and we're going to order save the dates as soon as we get the photos back from him. Julie has asked all but one of her ladies to be a bridesmaid, and I know who I'm going to choose to be my groomsmen. Julie has also ordered a dress after an exciting dress shopping experience with her family. We still need to book a tasting session with the caterer, but I think we're on track to get all of this done in short order.

# New 3 month goals

I'm going to write some of these as SMART goals, which means that they're:

- specific -- exactly what are you trying to do?
- measurable -- how do you measure success of this goal?
- attainable -- they need to be realisic. Don't set a goal for something you know you can't accomplish
- results-focused -- the goals should measure outcomes, not activities
- time-bound -- when do I want to accomplish this by, specifically?

I'll write some of them this way, but the others I'd like to leave intentionally more vague just so I have an idea of what I should have on the horizon.

By October 17th, I'd like to finish my website for ngLou (the name of the Angular meetup I'd like to start). It needs to have an upcoming events section along with a place for highlighting speakers.

Also by October 17th, I'd like to have the infrastructure in place for the meetup. I need to ask a few people if they would be interested in speaking at this meetup, and plan a meeting between my leader and the head of the security team at work to determine the feasibility of using our building for a meetup and to secure funding for food and whatnot. To meet this goal, I should have everything I need to schedule the first meetup.

By the end of October, I would like to finish the primary functionality of my freelance project. There are two (or three?) primary pieces of functionality left, and in order to meet this goal, they need to be implemented and function as intended.

By the end of the year, I would like to have planned at least two date nights with Julie. These should include somewhere decently fancy to eat accompanied by some sort of activity.

By the end of November, I would like to have my portfolio finished. I need to have a place to write technical blog posts, an about me section, and a place to showcase my projects.

By October 17, I would like to have asked all of the men that I would like to be in my wedding to be my groomsmen.

I would like to regain control of what I eat. At the beginning of the year throughout approximately a month or so ago, I was eating relatively healthy. Since then, I've started eating a lot of junk and I'm starting to feel the effects of that. I'm a bit more sluggish and generally unmotivated, and I've started gaining a bit of weight. Not a lot, but enough to realize that I need to correct my course before it gets out of control.

There are several people at work that have started discussing the stock market and have done a lot of research into investing. I would like to get involved in that, and I need to start doing my own research as well as find a way to start investing myself.

These are the long-term goals I would like to accomplish within the next 3 months. I'd like to continue planning at these 3 month intervals, and have some vague goals to keep on the horizon and make sure I have a sense of direction and what I should be doing to achieve those goals.
