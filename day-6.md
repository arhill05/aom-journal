## Day 6
### *Write a 6-word memoir of your life so far; that is, describe your life in one six-word sentence. With this limitation, you really have to filter your life to what you deem most important.*

**Passionate developer learning how life works.**

You can be passionate about a lot of things, but I make sure that I choose what I am passionate about wisely. I am passionate about software and web development, as indicated by the second word in my short memoir, but I am passionate about a lot of other things too. I am passionate about family, and having a happy home. I dedicate a lot of time and effort to spending time with friends and family. I am passionate about competition, and as a result I am a *very* competitive person. This comes out in me when I play video games or engage in other competitive activities like ping-pong. Sometimes I get legitimately upset at losing, simply because I am competitive and always strive to get better. I am passionate about changing things that aren't working. If something is broken, if a process is painful and strenuous, or if there is an opportunity to improve upon something, then it should be changed -- plain and simple. These are things that I will not back down on, and I will push hard to get what I want out of them.

I am a developer. I write code *all the time.* I love developing software, websites, and web applications so much that I decided to attend the University of Louisville for 4 years to get a degree in Computer Information Systems to make a career out of it. Now that I've done that, it's both my career and my hobby. I constantly have at least one side project that I am working on, and always take on every opportunity to find a new challenge at work.

Learning is my constant state. I know that there is always something that I can learn, whether it be about programming, life skills, or anything else. I know that if I ever stop learning, that will be the day I stop progressing towards my dream of success. Every new thing that I learn is another tool that I can use to continue further in life and pursue success.

How life works is something that I think very few, if any, people understand. However, some people understand different aspects of life more than others. Simple things such as home maintenance as a new homeowner, or paying bills, or learning to cook better meals, to more complex things like understanding the emotions of those around you, long-term goal planning, and being a leader are all aspects of how life works. Sometimes I have to take a step back and realize that I am still young. I've progressed at an accelerated pace ever since I graduated college -- within two years I took on a phenomenal job, bought a house, bought a (two) cars, proposed to the love of my life, and then some. Many of these are things that some people don't accomplish until they are 10 or more years ahead of where I am now. I don't mean for this to come off as a brag, but instead as a reminder to myself that there are still things I don't know about life. There is so much more to living that I haven't had the opportunity to come across yet. I am excited to continue learning how life works as it continues to throw new challenges at me.

This one was hard. Just like the prompt says, you have to stop and think really hard about what is most important in your life. An exercise like this really puts your priorities into a perspective that is easier to understand.
