## Day 12
### *Give stream-of-consciousness writing a try. This is where you just write out whatever comes into your head at the moment it comes into your head.*
#### 6/21/2018

The idea of stream of consciousness writing is that you just write whatever comes to your mind without judgement of the thing that you are thinking about. I don't like this idea because I like to sit and ponder about my answer to any question I may come across. This is me writing my stream of consciousness. I've got so many thoughts going on in my head right now it's hard for me to focus on writing about this one specific thing.

I can see where stream of consciousness writing might be useful for some people in getting their thoughts out of their head and onto something material, no matter what you're thinking about. I'm looking away from my screen while I type now, which seems to help me continue to write my stream of consciousness because I'm not focused on what's on the screen.

This prompt is not one that I am enjoying as much as others. Everything I'm writing right now goes against everything that I know about writing something good. I've got a lot of things to do today at work, I hope I can get them all done. I need to investigate why Windows would use the wrong version of NodeJS, and regroup with Mark about getting his Visual Studio set up to start exploring our code base. I am facilitating a demo of a feature I worked on this afternoon. Is there anything else on my calendar? I'm working out this afternoon and Julie is going out to get her nails done with a friend.

Todoist has been very helpful in keeping me productive and on track. I think I'll keep paying for it. I love being able to look at my list of things to do and prioritize them every day. I wish Google would roll out the Messages for Web update for me. I keep refreshing my available updates to see if I can get it yet, but no luck so far.

I think I'll end this prompt here. It seems rather meaningless and the content isn't very much fun to read.
