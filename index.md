## The Art of Manliness Journal Jumpstart

Here are my random ramblings that try to follow along with the points illustrated in the [Art of Manliness Journaling Challenge](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/jumpstart-your-journaling-a-31-day-challenge/). Feel free to leave any feedback you may have, or just start a conversation with me at [me@andrewhill.io](mailto:me@andrewhill.io).

>Doing something for around 30 days is a great way to not only build a habit, but to also explore if it’s right for you. Maybe journaling isn’t for you, and you just have never taken the time to really prove that to yourself. Or maybe you love the practice, and simply haven’t gotten into the habit yet.

### [[6/12/2018] Day 5 - What is your greatest dream in life?](./day-5)

### [[6/13/2018] Day 6 - Write a 6-word memoir of your life so far; that is, describe your life in one six-word sentence. With this limitation, you really have to filter your life to what you deem most important.](./day-6)

> Yesterday was a Sunday, so I woke up late. I normally sleep in on Sundays anyway, but I slept in until about 9:30-10:00 which is a lot later than I sleep until even on the weekends. Maybe I...

### [[6/22/2018] Day 13 - Perform a mind dump of everything you’re worried about. From the leaky dishwasher to your family member’s poor health – get it all out. (Use David Allen’s GTD trigger list to help you out if needed.)](./day-13)

> This question just seems like a more elaborate form of Day 6's prompt. A blurb on the front cover of a book normally isn't any longer than a sentence or two, so it's just a bit more detail...
