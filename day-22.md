## Day 22
### *Imagine you’ve been provided with a livable income for the rest of your life. You have no need to work, but aren’t rolling in money either. How would you spend your time? Your answer will say a lot about you and what your passion may be.*

*Okay maybe I'm slacking a little.*

I think what I do for a career now is pretty close to what I'd spend my time on if I had no need to work for the rest of my life. I love development, and I love tinkering with software. Building something that works and that is used by any number of people is what motivates me to continue working on the projects I have going on. I love learning about new technologies that emerge every day. I love the act of writing code and mapping the architecture of software out in my head. There's no reason to stop doing that when I have a legitimate passion for it. Doing this would hopefully lead me to my idea of success, too. I could build some awesome platform that a lot of people use that will make me a recognizable figure-head in society. I may make a bunch of money off of it so I could be "rolling in money" in the future.

One thing that I would for sure spend time doing is pursuing my private pilot's license. I have a dream to fly a helicopter one day. If I ever got the chance to fly a Huey, I'd take it in a heartbeat. Getting your pilot's license takes a lot of time and money, so the lack of a need to work for an income would help tremendously in achieving that goal.

I know this one is short and sweet, but I'm already pretty close to how I would spend my time if I had a livable income without needing to work. There's not much to fantasize about when I'm already pretty happy doing what I do now.
